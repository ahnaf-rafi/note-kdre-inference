\section{Introduction}

In this note, we explore inference techniques for kernel estimators of density
and conditional mean regression functions.
We consider pointwise inference, uniform inference results are left for the
future, either in a different document or future versions of the present
document.
The key guiding principle of the results presented in the present note will be
as follows.
There are standard Gaussian inference results for kernel estimators of density
and regression functions.
In these, the standard error estimators require the use of the estimated density
and regression functions.
However, we can formulate more ``intuitive'' standard error estimators that
utilize the fact that kernel estimators are sample averages.
These also work in that they are consistent in the appropriate sense and ensure
that resulting \(t\)-statistics are asymptotically standard normal.
